# Rock! Paper! Scissors! Shoot!

This project was done independently by me for my Computational Expressions class. This uses VPython to create everything which was then done on Trinket.

## How I Came Up With the Idea
With this project, I'm diving into an exciting reinterpretation of the timeless rock, paper, scissors game. Picture this: you, as the player, are stepping into a virtual arena against a CPU armed with a repertoire of randomized maneuvers. Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and you will), is to select your weapon of choice from the iconic trio: rock, paper, or scissors. Once you've thrown down your choice, the magic unfolds. An intricate sequence kicks in—enter a captivating animation featuring dynamically rendered fists brought to life through the magic of the vpython framework. These fists engage in the quintessential rocking motion, injecting a dose of visual dynamism into the gaming experience. Next up, your chosen move takes the spotlight, seamlessly weaving into the virtual duel's narrative. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the CPU autonomously executes its unpredictable move, adding an element of suspense and surprise. What you get is an interactive masterpiece, a fusion of strategic decision-making and digital artistry promising an exhilarating gameplay experience. The clash of virtual fists and the unpredictable dance of the CPU's choices converge to create a dynamic and visually captivating spectacle. It's not just a game; it's an immersive journey into the thrilling intersection of strategy and digital creativity.

## Final Thoughts
This project was super exciting, I really enjoyed creating my initial idea that I proposed. The rock, paper, scissors game I created turned out to be super similar to my plan. The only thing I added was the Rock! Paper! Scissors! Shoot! Text that flashes after a game is played. I was very in between making the color of the arms resemble skin tones or just bright colors in order to be more inclusive. In the end, I decided to just use skin tones since I wanted it to feel more realistic. I learned a lot more in this final project than other ones just because we actually had to implement everything we learned in the course so far here. I missed classes, methods, and dictionaries since I couldn’t figure out where to put them or what to add in order to get points for those. I wish I was able to use them since I think I am the least confident about them. I think Python is super well designed and super beginner friendly. At this moment in time, there is nothing I could think of that would make it more effective. For VPython, I would love if we had an option to make 2D shapes and texts.
